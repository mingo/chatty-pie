# chatty-pie
![a chatty magpie](http://i.imgur.com/Wj2wJev.jpg)

Simple application offering a REST api to buy chat rooms for their users.
The [chatty-pie-connector][1] is using that API.

This is a Python app that runs on Google App Engine.
This started as a fork of [Google's own appengine-guestbook-python][2].
So thank Google for the original code.

Master is deployed at:
* https://chattypie-191201.appspot.com

## Entities
* `Account`: it owns a bunch of `chatrooms`.
* `Chatroom`: contains a bunch of `posts` made by `users`. Has a name, a type (`trial` or `standard`), a status (`active` or `suspended`) and is owned by an `Account`.
* `Post`: added to a `chatroom` by a `user`. Has content and a timestamp.
* `User`: the one making `posts` to `chatrooms`. Can have access to >1 rooms.

## Requirements
* Python 2.7 - `brew install python`
* [Google Cloud SDK][3] - install it & run `gcloud init`

## How to develop?
* use [pycharm][4] or any text editor

## Test with Postman
Just create an environment in Postman with the following fields:
* host: points to the chatty-pie instance
* account_id: for account specific requests
* domain: for domain specific requests
* room_id: for room specific requests
* user_email: for room user specific

Finally, use the button below to import the Postman collection

[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://app.getpostman.com/run-collection/4e15f19e8fc79d93728a)

## How to run locally?
* have the requirements: `python` & `gcloud`.
* `dev_appserver.py .`
* open `http://localhost:8080`

## How to deploy?
* `gcloud app deploy app.yaml`
* Stack traces about `NeedIndexError` are transient: they will disappear after 5 minutes or so (until indices are created.)
